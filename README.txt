The input folder contains the input or dataset, their are over 17k titles 
in the original dataset. we created a dataset containing first 15 movies and is stored in mv_0000001.txt.

The recommender is run by running the Driver class, it calls all the jobs and has the input args configuration for all the classes.

Each job creates a output folder and name can be specified in Driver class. 

The final output of the recommender system is produced in accumulate folder for all the users.


Note: We worked on single machine i.e sairam vm so during the project execution we all connected on zoom and 
worked on code with remote control. Hence it is difficult to give authorship to any individual.
